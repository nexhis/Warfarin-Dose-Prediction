Final Project Report Warfarin Dose Prediction using Machine Learning
Abstract: Warfarin is a prescription drug which interferes with normal blood coagulation. Prescribing an accurate dosage of Warfarin is of great importance to avoid serious complications. 
In this project, I developed several machine learning models aiming to aid clinical professionals prescribe the correct dosage based on the most important patientâ€™s features.
The models achieved a high degree of accuracy, between 75 and 79% depending on the method used. A Gradio interface was also developed to facilitate the use of the models.
For details please refer to the pdf document.
